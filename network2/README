- To run the server you need only to execute:
    python Server.py

- To run the client you need for example:
$ make
$ ./client 128000
where 128000 is the sequence size parameter.

Then type CTRL+C to SIGINT the client and get the throughput statistics.
The output is something like:

17292 number of sequences * 500000 sequence size * 8 bit 
---------------------------------------------------------- = 5613.57 Mbps
           12.321567 seconds * 1000000
